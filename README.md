## Introduction

### [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)

In number theory, this hypotesis states that repeating two simple arithmetic operations over any natural number we will always eventually reach 1.

The operations are:

Numbers from 1 to (aprox.) 2⁶⁸ have been checked to reach 1.



## Why is it useful to study the paths "mod N"?
